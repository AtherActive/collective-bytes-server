# AuraCSS - Keep it Simple
> AuraCSS is in active development and may change frequently. Make sure to check in every now and then to make sure your verison is up to date with the latest features.

AuraCSS is a relatively simple CSS/SCSS framework. It was build as I personally really dislike Bootstrap and like Tailwind. The idea behind this framework is to be a "Hybrid"
between Bootstap and Tailwind. Containing some basic modules like Bootstrap but also haivng the option to add countless utility classes to improve the look fo your site.

## Features
- Components for frequently used things, like Navbars and Footers
- A grid system based on Flex with configurable amounts of sizes
- Highly customizable: Remove modules you dont need easily
- Utility classes to provide quick styling when needed
- Fully Responsive

## In-depth about everything

## How to use
Using AuraCSS can be as easy as you want it! We'l explain both methods down here.

### Compile your own
AuraCSS uses Sass and can easily be compiled to your needs! With this method you are able to enable and disable all modules and fully customize every little detail!
1. Clone this repository using your favorite tool
2. Open the folder in an editor/terminal
3. Run `npm i` to install the Sass compiler we use
4. Customize!

Once you are done customizing you want to actually compile it, this is as simple as running `npm run scss` and saving the `auracss.scss` file. You can now use the CSS file in `./css` for your project!

### Prebuild CSS file
You can link/download the prebuild CSS file of Auracss to include it quickly on your website. Do note that this makes customizability less accessible.
